*NO LONGER MAINTAINED* Makes it easy to add Afrigator.com's tracking code to your Wordpress-powered site.

== Description ==

*NO LONGER MAINTAINED*
With Afrigator.com being just a shell of its former self, being up and down, it just isn't worth keeping this plugin up to date.
*NO LONGER MAINTAINED*

Afrigator is a social media aggregator and directory built especially for African digital citizens who publish and consume content on the Web.
You can use Afrigator to index your blog, podcast, videocast or news site (i.e. any site that publishes an RSS feed) and market it to the rest of Africa and the world. 

This plugin makes it easy to add Afrigator.com's tracking code to your Wordpress-powered site.

== Installation ==

Install the plugin from within your Wordpress administration, or download it, extract it (make sure the folder is called "wp-afrigator"!) and place it in /wp-content/plugins.

1. Enable the plugin
2. Go to "Settings > WP-Afrigator" and set it up.

If you choose to use one of the standard buttons, you'll have to go to "Appearance > Widgets" and add the WP-Afrigator widget to one of your sidebars.
